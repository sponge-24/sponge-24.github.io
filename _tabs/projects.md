## Threat Intelligence Extractor

**Tech Stack:** `RAG` `LLM` `Neo4j` `VirusTotal` `Splunk` `YARA` `ChromaDB`

Developed a threat intelligence system using a RAG architecture with Qwen 2.5 LLM and ChromaDB, integrating ioc finder with VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB for automated IOC verification. Established a knowledge graph with Neo4j, deployed a Splunk SIEM with YARA rules for monitoring, and enabled a chat-with-PDF feature for interactive analysis.
